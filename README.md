Emotion Tracker Using DeepFace

This project is an Emotion Recognition system that uses DeepFace, a lightweight facial analysis framework. It detects the face from webcam input and identifies the user's current emotional state such as happy, sad, angry, fearful, etc.

Overview

The application uses your webcam to capture real-time video, detects faces, and predicts the emotion using a pre-trained deep learning model provided by DeepFace. It's useful for mood tracking, emotional analytics, or integration with human-computer interaction systems.
